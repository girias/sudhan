shopping services, the team is just starting to implement their online shopping application,
which will receive a shopping list from the customer and deliver the items in the shopping
list. For the start, they start with few modules of the application. The tech team has planned
to implement this application, help them writing codes for login validation, making a
purchase and displaying the purchase details.
a) Initially, the application reads the username from the user, if an invalid username is
given, the application loops until a valid username is given.
b) Once a valid username is given, the application prompts for the item to be purchased, the
system displays “Invalid item number” until a valid item number is given and then the
quantity of the item is read from the user.
c) Once the user completes giving the list of items to be purchased, the list of items along
with the item number, item name and the cost is displayed with the total cost of the
shopping list.
d) When the user selects Exit, the application terminates.
