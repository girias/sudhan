The Intelli Machine solutions have digitized their process of assigning the asset to an
employee and getting them back. The system generates a log file, where all the
assignments and the returns are captures in a CSV file. 
Since few of the assets are on-demand, the Asset management team has requested to buy
few assets, for which the Procurement team has to go on audit trail of few reports. The
Asset management system has only log files and
xml files as source to assets and their users. With this files and logs, write the code to get
the following reports. 
1) The summary report
2) View all available assets of a category
3) View all currently assigned assets of an employee
4) View all currently assigned assets
5) View all assets of a category
1) “The summary report” will contain
a) Total number of assets
b) Total number of users
c) Frequently assigned assets
d) Frequent consumers

2) “View all available assets of a category”
The category id is read from the user, if the category id is invalid, display “Invalid category
id”, else if the category id is correct then display the assets along with its number and name
ordered by the asset number.
3) “View all currently assigned assets of an employee”
The employee id is read as input and “Invalid employee id” is displayed if it not correct.
When a correct employee id is given, list of assets he/she holds is displayed with its number
and name ordered by the asset number
4) “View all currently assigned assets”
Displays all the assigned assets along with the number, name, user and date( recent )
ordered by the date(asc) and asset number.
5) “View all assets of a category”
The category id is read as input from the user, “Invalid category id” if the id is not correct
and if correct, display the assets along with its number and name ordered by the asset’s
number.
Note:
1) The application terminates after printing any of the report

2) The assets are available in an xml file named assets.xml
3) The employee details are available in an xml file named user.xml
4) The log file of the asset management system is a comma seperated file(CSV) is available
in the file named log.csv
